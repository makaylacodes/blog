                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                1. Place the peeled shrimp in a bowl with 1 Tablespoon of oil, 
                one minced garlic clove, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon black
                 pepper. Toss to coat and let marinade while cooking the 
                 vegetables.<br><br>

                2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat with 2 Tablespoons of 
                vegetable oil. Add the onion and bell pepper and let cook for 
                approximately 3 minutes. <br><br>

                3. Add the 2 coarsely chopped garlic cloves and cook for about 
                1 minute. Add the canned diced tomatoes, basil, and cilantro/
                parsley. Let cook for about 2 minutes. Transfer the cooked 
                vegetables to a blender and set aside. <br> <br>

                4. Add the 2 remaining Tablespoons of oil to the skillet and 
                cook the shrimp for 2 minutes, then flip and cook for another 
                1-2 minutes or it until starts getting pink. Transfer the shrimp 
                to a plate or bowl.<br><br>

                5. Add the coconut milk, chicken/vegetable broth, lime juice, 
                ground ginger, paprika (optional), and the remaining salt and 
                pepper to the cooked, reserved vegetables and blend everything 
                until vegetables are completely ground and mixture is homogeneous.<br><br>

                6. Transfer blended mixture to the skillet and bring to a boil; 
                then reduce to simmer and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the 
                cream cheese and stir until melted and the sauce is creamy and 
                homogeneous. <br><br>

                7. Add the cooked shrimp to the skillet and toss to coat. Garnish 
                with basil leaves, chopped cilantro/parsley, and slices of red 
                jalapeno pepper if desired. Serve over white rice (preferably) 
                or noodles. Enjoy!<br><br>
