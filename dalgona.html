                whipped Coffee, cloud Coffee, magic coffee and more. No matter 
                how you call it, this cold coffee is AMAZING! <br><br>
                This coffee has been viral in Korea during quarantine time, 
                then it got viral on TikTok and now it is very trendy all over the internet. 
                Dalgona Coffee is a cold latte drink that comes with a velvety 
                smooth and sweet coffee foam on top. The combination of cold milk
                 and the bittersweet coffee is absolutely delicious. <br><br>
                 Dalgona coffee 
                 is inspired by the South Korean dalgona candy, a toffee sponge that 
                 resembles the creamy dollop that tops the ice coffee. So if you want 
                 to learn how to make dalgona coffee, follow this easy recipe (only 4 
                 ingredients).<br><br>

                <h2>How to Drink Dalgona Coffee</h2>
                <p>
                    After whipping the coffee, whisk it with a good amount of milk 
                    (any milk would work). Make sure you are whisking well and not 
                    leaving the whipped part at the top, otherwise the coffee will 
                    be bitter. <br><br>

                <h2>What Coffee is The Best for Dalgona Coffee?<h2>
                <p>
                The best coffee for frothy dalgona coffee is granulated 
                instant coffee. Some recipes say that you can use powdered 
                inatant coffee or instant espresso powdered, I find that 
                granulated instant coffee gives the best results and would 
                not recommend using any other coffee. <br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>Dalgona Coffee Recipe</h2>
                <p>
                ▢  2 tablespoons Instant coffee<br>
                ▢  2 tablespoons Sugar<br>
                ▢  2 tablespoons Hot water<br>
                ▢  1/2 cup (120ml) Milk of your choice<br>
                ▢  2-3 Ice cubes<br>
                </p>
               

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                1. In a large mixing bowl place coffee, sugar and hot water 
                (1:1:1 ratio).<br><br>

                2. Using a hand mixer or electric mixer, whisk until thick 
                and creamy. <br><br>

                3. Fill only 3/4 of a cup with cold milk and add ice cubes.<br><br>

                4. Top it up with foamy whipped coffee. Mix well before drink. 
                Enjoy!<br><br>
                </p>


                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <p>
                1. Do I have to use sugar? The sugar helps the coffee whip to a fluffy 
                and stable texture that holds its shape for a while. You can reduce 
                sugar amount, but I’m not sure it will be so fluffy. If you’re really s
                ensitive to sugar, you can reduce it down, just know that your coffee 
                won’t be as fluffy.
                <br><br>
                2. What kind of milk to use: You can use cow’s milk, dairy free milk 
                such as almond milk, oat milk or any other kind of milk that you 
                prefer.<br><br>
                3. Can I make Dalgona coffee without electric mixer? Yes, you can 
                whip the coffee using a regular whisk, it may take a little bit 
                more time, but it absolutely possible.<br><br>
