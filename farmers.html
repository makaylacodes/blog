                Farmers markets, along with breweries with giant patios, a 
                lakefront that may as well be the ocean, and a skyline like 
                no other make summers in Chicago worth the cold, hard winters 
                we endure. If you’re like me, this means you tend to overdo it 
                when the farmers markets are around, remembering back to the winter 
                when you subsisted on beer and brats alone. Fresh kale, piled high and 
                vibrant green? Yes, please. Zucchinis as far as they eye can see? 
                In the bag they go.<br><br>
                Instead of being overwhelmed by what is soon to be prime farmer’s 
                market season, follow these tips to make sure you make the best of 
                the markets without wasting all of that beautiful produce!<br><br>

                <h2>1. Make A Plan and Stick To It</h2>
                <p>
                    Make a list of what you’re cooking this week (even a general 
                    list is better than no list at all!). Even if you don’t know
                     exactly what you’ll make, have some things in mind: a salad 
                     one night, for example, and veggies on the grill the next. 
                     Thinking about how you’re going to cook the vegetables/food 
                     you’re eating this week will help steer you towards the 
                     produce that’ll fit into your plan for the week. Don’t 
                     get too distracted by the bounty that the market has to 
                     offer — you’ll end up throwing away all of that fresh produce 
                     you didn’t use. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>2. Bring Your Own Bag<h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve been the person juggling my iced coffee, a dog 
                    leash and errant tomatoes at the market, and trust me 
                    when I say that it’s just as uncomfortable as it looks. 
                    Instead of relying on the farmers to bring plastic bags 
                    for your produce, find a tote you love and pack it full 
                    of veggies. Better for the environment, better for the 
                    farmers, and better for your walk home! <br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>3. Ask For Advice</h2>
                <p>
                    Not sure what that twisty green veggie is? Unclear on how 
                    fast you need to use up this fresh goat’s milk cheese? 
                    Standing in front of a table full of produce and not sure 
                    what will taste best with skirt steak? I have great news 
                    for you: there’s an expert ready, willing and excited to 
                    answer your question right across the table from you. Nobody 
                    knows the produce you’re buying better than the people selling 
                    it! Ask questions, get advice, and maybe even nab a family 
                    recipe or two.<br><br>
                </p>
               

                <h2>4. Look Beyond The Produce</h2>
                <p>
                    This isn’t just a place to nab fresh fruits and veggies. 
                    Farmer’s markets are filled with all sorts of treats, 
                    from roasted heirloom tomatoes in jars to preserved black 
                    garlic to candles to coffee beans. Stop by those stands on 
                    your walk to meet your new favorite pantry items (and to grab 
                    a snack to munch on the way through!).<br><br>

                <h2>5. Leave A Little Room For A Surprise</h2>
                <p>I know, I know. I just told you to make a plan and 
                    stick to it to avoid getting overwhelmed. But if 
                    there’s one thing I’ve learned in my years of farmer’s 
                    market meanderings, it’s that there’s always one thing 
                    that catches my eye. Whether it’s a bouquet of wildflowers 
                    or a jar of Bloody Mary mix, a little something always 
                    takes up the last corner of my tote. Keep your eyes open, 
                    and enjoy the markets!<br><br>
