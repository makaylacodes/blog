                The Best Cloud Bread Recipe: Low carb, keto, low fat, 
                gluten-free, grain-free bread you can use for sandwiches
                 on a low carb diet!<br>

                <p>
                    I’ve been pretty impressed with cloud bread. 
                    I wish I knew who invented it, so I could give them credit,
                     and possibly and little bow of respect. I’ve heard it originally 
                     came into existence during the Atkins era.<br><br>
                     For those who don’t know, Cloud Bread is high in protein and 
                     extremely low in carbs, making it the perfect sandwich bread 
                     for those on a low carb, gluten free, or grain free diet.<br><br>
                     Each “slice” is baked separately and has a soufflé-like texture 
                     when it first comes out of the oven. After a couple hours, 
                     the texture becomes more bread like, so you won’t even miss 
                     traditional wheat bread.<br><br>
                     t’s a soft airy bread made with only eggs, a little cream cheese
                      (some people use cottage cheese) and cream of tartar. 
                      Honestly, other than seasoning, that’s it for this cloud bread 
                      recipe!<br><br>

                <h2>4 Different Ways to Use Cloud Bread<h2>
                <p>
                This cloud bread recipe isn’t just good for sandwiches either! 
                Try using cloud bread with these other uses:<br><br>
                ▢  Toast – top with butter, or honey. But be careful when toasting, 
                cloud bread can quickly turn to ash… <br>
                ▢  Soup – find yourself a veggie based soup for healthy reasons and 
                try dipping your bread in.<br>
                ▢  Pizza – make mini pizzas with your low carb bread.<br>
                ▢  Breadsticks – sprinkle with cheese and a little olive oil or 
                butter to make delicious breadsticks!<br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>The Best Cloud Bread Recipe</h2>
                <p>
                ▢  4 large eggs, separated<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon cream of tartar<br>
                ▢  12 ounces low-fat cream cheese<br>
                ▢  1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoningr<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon sea salt<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> - <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon garlic powder<br>
   
                </p>
               

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. If you have a convection oven, set on convect. 
                Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. 
                <br><br>

                2. Separate the egg whites and egg yolks. Place the whites in a stand mixer with a 
                whip attachment. Add the cream of tartar and beat on high until the froth turns 
                into firm meringue peaks. Move to a separate bowl. <br><br>

                3. Place the cream cheese in the empty stand mixing bowl. Beat on high to soften. 
                Then add the egg yolks one at a time to incorporate. Scrape the bowl and beat 
                until the mixture is completely smooth. Then beat in the Italian seasoning, salt, 
                and garlic powder.<br><br>

                4. Gently fold the firm meringue into the yolk mixture. Try to deflate the meringue 
                as little as possible, so the mixture is still firm and foamy. Spoon 1/4 cup portions 
                of the foam onto the baking sheets and spread into even 4-inch circles, 3/4 inch high.
                 Make sure to leave space around each circle.<br><br>

                5. Bake on convect for 15-18 minutes, or in a conventional oven for up to 30 minutes. 
                The bread should be golden on the outside and firm. The center should not jiggle 
                when shaken. Cool for several minutes on the baking sheets, then move and serve!<br><br>

                </p>


                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <p>
                1. The Best Cloud Bread Recipe can be stored in an airtight container in the 
                refrigerator for several days. However the texture is best if eaten within 
                12 hours of baking.
                <br><br>
                2. Go easy on the garlic powder the first time you make it. I like adding 
                1/2 teaspoon, but that might be a little much for some palates.<br><br>
