                    Hi there! My name is Natasha Kravchuk. My handsome husband, 
                    Vadim, and I started Natasha’s Kitchen in 2009 and develop 
                    recipes and recipe videos full time together.<br><br>
                    I come from a family of fantastic cooks and I’m here to share 
                    generations of recipes that are homey, fresh, healthy, family-friendly, 
                    authentic, and  adventurous. Most importantly, our recipes taste great 
                    and you can trust that they actually work.<br><br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="title">
                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I am so thankful to be full-time a foodie and recipe developer. I am 
                    living my dream because of you and I can’t thank you enough! I draw 
                    on all of my past experiences which make me the recipe developer, 
                    video creator, photographer, writer, and business owner that I am 
                    today. I set the bar high so you can expect great recipes and videos 
                    here. God has made all of my past experiences working for my good.  <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="title">
                    <h2>The 'Resume'</h2>
                </div>
                <p>
                    ▢ Starting as a teen, I worked for 7 years as a business intern (my 
                    most valuable ‘education’).<br>
                    ▢ Earned my bachelors degree in Business (long story)<br>
                    ▢ Worked as a Realtor for 4 years during which I had an early mid-life crisis 
                    and cried a lot (let’s just say it wasn’t for me).<br>
                    ▢ Second Bachelor’s degree in Nursing and worked as an RN in telemetry 
                    (shorter story, but still long).<br>
                    ▢ Blogging since 2009<br><br>
                    
                    So, I’m a wife, mom, food blogger, video creator, photographer, writer, influencer, 
                    social media boss, entrepreneur, and worship leader. If I were a sandwich, 
                    I’d be a chicken bacon avocado on focaccia.<br>
                    <br>
