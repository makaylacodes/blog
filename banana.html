                <h2>Banana Bread Recipe</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my husband’s recipe which he has perfected over 
                    the years and he is known for his Banana Bread. He makes it 
                    frequently and it always disappears fast! It is simple to make 
                    and our favorite way to use up overripe bananas so they never go 
                    to waste. It’s super moist and makes a great breakfast on-the-go. 
                    We even created Banana Muffins from this recipe.<br><br>

                    This loaf stays moist for days and also makes for a thoughtful and 
                    delicious gift idea for the holidays (I’ll take banana bread over 
                    fruit cake any day).<br><br><br>

                <h2>Ingredients for Banana Bread:<h2>
                <p>
                    This is everything you need to make the best banana bread: flour, 
                    sugar, salt, baking soda, vanilla extract, softened butter, eggs 
                    and of course very ripe bananas. Adding walnuts and raisins is 
                    optional but adds great taste and texture, turning it into a 
                    banana nut bread. <br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Can I Omit Walnuts and Raisins?</h2>
                <p>
                    YES! The recipe will still work if raisins and walnuts are omitted. 
                    We make it nut-free all the time due to a walnut allergy in the 
                    family. You will still have the softest, super moist and scrumptious 
                    loaf. You can also replace them with some chocolate to make Chocolate 
                    Chip Banana Bread. <br><br><br>

                <h2>Can I Freeze Overripe Bananas?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have overripe bananas and aren’t ready to bake with them, 
                    DO NOT throw them away!<br><br>
                    <b>How to Freeze Bananas: </b>place them un-peeled in a freezer-safe bag, 
                    remove any excess air and freeze up to 3 months. You can use thawed 
                    bananas for banana bread. You can also freeze them peeled and cut into 
                    pieces for easier use in smoothies. P.S. You can also freeze a whole banana 
                    bread with the same method!<br><br><br>

                <h2>Banana Bread Recipe</h2>
                <p>
                ▢  3 very ripe bananas (medium/large)<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup unsalted butter (8 Tbsp) at room temperature<br>
                ▢  <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup granulated sugar<br>
                ▢  2 large eggs lightly beaten<br>
                ▢  1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups all-purpose flour<br>
                ▢  1 tsp baking soda<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp salt<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp vanilla extract<br>
                ▢  1 cup walnuts<br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup raisins<br>
               

            </p>
               

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a bread loaf pan 
                (9.25 long x 5.25 wide x 2.75 deep). Lightly roast walnuts on a 
                skillet, continuously stirring so they won’t burn. Coarsely chop 
                and cool to room temperature. <br><br>

                2. In a mixing bowl, cream together 8 Tbsp softened butter and <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> 
                cup sugar (or honey if using honey).<br><br>

                3. Mash bananas with a fork until the consistency of chunky applesauce 
                and add them to the batter along with 2 eggs, mixing until 
                blended. <br><br>

                4. In a separate bowl, whisk together: 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups of flour, 1 tsp of 
                baking soda and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp of salt then add to batter.<br><br>

                5. Add <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp of vanilla extract and mix in chopped walnuts and raisins. 
                Pour into prepared loaf pan. Bake at 350˚F for 55-60 min or until a 
                toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let banana bread rest 
                for 10 min before transferring to a wire rack to cool.<br><br>
