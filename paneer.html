                ▢  3 tablespoons heavy cream <br>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon cayenne pepper (see note 4) <br>
                </p>
                <h4>To Serve</h4>
                <p>
                ▢  cooked basmati rice <br>
                ▢  cilantro (optional) <br>
                ▢  red pepper flakes (optional) <br>
            </p>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                1. Slice the block of paneer into 1-inch cubes. Then, slice each 
                cube into 2 or 3 slices. Transfer the paneer to a mixing bowl. 
                <br><br>

                2. In a small bowl, stir the yogurt, ginger, garlic, cumin, paprika, 
                and salt. Pour this yogurt marinade over the paneer and mix together. 
                Refrigerate the paneer for at least 30 minutes. <br><br>

                3. Once the paneer has been marinated, pan fry the paneer. Heat a 
                nonstick frying pan (or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet) with 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> 
                tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Arrange the pieces of paneer over 
                the pan in a single layer. You probably need to fry the paneer in batches. 
                Cook for 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown. Flip over all the pieces, and 
                pan fry for another 2 minutes. <br><br>

                4. Transfer the fried paneer to a plate and turn off the heat. Quickly wipe 
                down the pan with a paper towel and return the heat to medium. <br><br>

                5. Drizzle the remaining 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons of oil to the pan and cook the 
                remaining paneer. Because the pan is very hot already, be careful as you
                 add the paneer to the pan, as it will splatter. Save any leftover yogurt 
                 marinade. You will add it to the sauce later. Transfer the cooked paneer 
                 to a pan.<br><br>

                6. In a separate large sauté pan, add another 2 tablespoons of safflower 
                oil over medium heat. Add the onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook for 
                5 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the onions from burning. If the 
                onions brown very quickly, reduce the heat slightly.  <br><br>

                7. Add the ginger, garlic, coriander, paprika, garam masala, turmeric,
                 black pepper, and remaining teaspoon of salt to the skillet. Cook for 
                 30 seconds and coat the onions with the spices. <br><br>
                
                8. Add the tomatoes, sugar, and water, and reduce the heat to medium-low 
                (see note 5). Cover the pan, and let everything simmer for 10 minutes. 
                Remove the lid and add the heavy cream, leftover yogurt marinade, and 
                cayenne pepper. Stir to combine. <br><br>

                9. If you are blending the sauce, turn off the heat now and let the sauce 
                cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a blender to blend. Pour the sauce 
                back into the pan and turn the heat to medium. <br><br>

                10. Finally, add the cooked paneer to the sauce and let it heat up for 
                about 1 minute. Turn off the heat. Garnish the paneer tikka masala with 
                cilantro and pepper flakes, if you like. Serve with cooked basmati rice 
                or jasmine rice. <br><br>
                </p>


                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <p>
                1. I used store-bought paneer for this recipe because it is sturdier. 
                You can also use homemade paneer. <br><br>
                2. I don’t recommend using Greek yogurt because it isn’t runny enough.<br><br>
                3. If you don’t have fresh tomatoes, you can use 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups crushed or diced 
                tomatoes (about <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of a large can of tomatoes). Note that canned tomatoes 
                tend to be more acidic than fresh tomatoes. As a result, you many need to 
                add 1 or 2 more teaspoons of sugar to balance out the acidity. <br><br>
                4. I purposely added the cayenne pepper in the end because this gives the 
                dish spice without it being overly fiery. If you simmer the tomatoes with
                 cayenne pepper at the beginning, the spiciness will be much more intense.<br><br>
                5. If you want more sauce, you can add a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup more water as you simmer the tomatoes. 
                Note that you’ll add to need a bit more salt so that the sauce doesn’t taste watered down.
