                TikTok’s latest culinary sensation is a brilliant dessert 
                hack—and it only requires three ingredients. With all the 
                hours we’re now devoting to kitchen work, the last thing 
                you want to think about is spending even more time whipping up 
                a decadent homemade dessert.<br><br>
                But what if we told you that all it takes is the combination of 
                sugar, egg yolk, and vanilla ice cream, to create a mouthwatering 
                crème brûlée that would make Julia Child proud? That’s right, we’re 
                talking the sweet French classic prepared with simply a trio of common 
                ingredients—and you don’t even need any special equipment.<br><br>
                It works perfectly because melted vanilla ice cream is essentially the 
                same thing as a homemade custard—but rather than simmering and whisking cream 
                and eggs, you just pop the ice cream in the microwave and add an extra 
                yolk once melted.<br><br>

                Thank TikTok user @shefshaq for making the original Tasty recipe even 
                better by figuring out how to recreate the signature crackly caramel 
                crust of crème brûlée without a blowtorch.<br><br>
                But we’ll go one further: What if you don’t have ramekins either? 
                Any similarly sized, oven-safe cup or bowl will work (as will a 
                small baking dish for a larger portion of crème brûlée)—or you 
                can use muffin pans; not ideal for guests, but you’re only serving 
                yourself here anyway. Whatever you use, just don’t forget the water bath.<br><br><br>
                </p>

                <h2>3-Ingredient Crème Brûlée Recipe</h2>
                <p>
                ▢  <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup vanilla ice cream<br>
                ▢  1 egg yolk<br>
                ▢  1 tablespoon white sugar<br>
              
                </p>
               

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                1. Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).<br><br>

                2. Nuke the ice cream in a microwave-safe measuring cup for 
                30 seconds or until melted. Let cool a bit if hot. <br><br>

                3. Whisk in the yolk until fully combined.<br><br>

                4. Pour the custard into ramekins. Or whatever oven-safe 
                vessels you’re using.!<br><br>

                5. Place the ramekins in a pan or baking dish and fill it
                 with water until the water reaches halfway up the ramekins. <br><br>
                
                 6. Bake for 40-50 minutes until the crème is mostly set. <br><br>

                 7. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it onto the surface of the crème,
                  and refrigerate for several hours. Bring to room temperature when 
                  ready to eat.<br><br>

                  8. Heat sugar in a small non-stick saute pan on the stove until it’s 
                  caramelized, then pour over the crème and tilt the ramekin to spread 
                  evenly across the top. Let the melted sugar harden. <br><br><br>
