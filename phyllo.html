                Frozen phyllo dough is a great time saver: you can create 
                appetizers, pastries and desserts without having to make the 
                dough. Traditionally, phyllo dough is made by stretching a 
                flour-and-water dough very slowly and carefully across a 
                cloth-covered table until the dough is so thin that the 
                tablecloth can be seen through the dough!<br><br>
                Frozen phyllo works very well, but it must be handled 
                carefully. Just remove it from the freezer 24 hours 
                before you want to use it and allow it to thaw in the
                 refrigerator.<br><br><br>
               <p>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/blog-11.jpg" alt="">

                    Phyllo is always used in multiple layers, giving it 
                    its characteristic crackly, flaky texture. 
                    The tissue-like sheets are stacked, with butter brushed
                     on each layer to add flavor and crispness. Don’t worry 
                     if the sheets tear a little. To save time, you can use 
                     cooking spray between the layers to create the same 
                     flaky effect. You will want to keep the stack of unbuttered 
                     dough sheets covered with a slightly dampened dish towel at 
                     all times, because phyllo dries out very quickly. <br><br>

                     <b>Tip:</b> Always butter the top layer of pastry before baking 
                     in a hot oven to create a nice golden-brown top.<br><br><br>

                    Phyllo pastries come in many different shapes and sizes. You can use
                     phyllo to create large or appetizer-size strudels, triangles, beggars’ 
                     purses, turnovers, or full-size dishes that are cut before serving 
                     (like baklava or spinach pie). The final shape of the pastry determines 
                     how many sheets of phyllo you need to start out with. For example, a 
                     pastry with a lot of folds, like a triangle, needs fewer sheets to 
                     start out with because they get layered as they are folded. Typically, 
                     phyllo dishes should have a finished thickness of 3 to 10 sheets per 
                     layer. (A one-pound box of phyllo contains about 20 sheets.)<br><br>

                     <b>Tip: </b>Phyllo pastries can often be very brittle when baked. We 
                     recommend using a serrated knife to cut the finished dish to prevent 
                     all of the filling from squishing out.<br><br>
                </p>

                    Almost anything can fill phyllo pastries. Appetizer pastries are delicious 
                    filled with thick fillings based on cheeses like goat cheese, feta or cream 
                    cheese. Most fillings, with the exception of some fruit fillings, should be 
                    completely cooked before stuffing the phyllo. Traditionally, phyllo dishes 
                    hail from the Mediterranean, so all types of Near Eastern and Greek filling 
                    ideas work well (think spanakopita and baklava) but you can try other combinations 
                    and create your own phyllo specialties. (Asian phyllo spring rolls, Hungarian apple
                     strudel, Latin American empanadas, etc.)<br><br>
                     <b>Tip: </b> Make them ahead of time! Freeze the finished pastries 
                     (unbaked) in a single layer on a sheet tray, then bake (without thawing) 
                     whenever you need a quick hors d’oeuvre!<br><br><br>
